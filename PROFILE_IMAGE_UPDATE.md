# Profile Image & Duplicate Field Removal - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added profile image upload functionality for all users and removed duplicate profile picture and Emirates ID fields from the quote request form. Users now upload these documents once in their profile, and they're automatically used for quote requests.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_10_08_102225_add_profile_image_to_users_table.php`
- Added `profile_image` column (nullable string) to users table
- Stores path to user's profile picture in `storage/app/public/profile_images/`

### 2. User Model Updates
**File:** `app/Models/User.php`
- Added `profile_image` to fillable array for mass assignment

### 3. Authentication Controller Enhancements
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Web/AuthController.php`

#### Updated Methods:
- **`register()`**: Now handles profile image upload during registration
  - Validates profile image (JPG, JPEG, PNG, max 2MB)
  - Stores in `storage/app/public/profile_images/`
  - Automatically cleans up on replacement

- **`updateProfile()`**: Enhanced to handle profile image updates
  - Validates profile image upload
  - Deletes old profile image when new one is uploaded
  - Maintains both profile image and EID file uploads

### 4. Registration Form Enhancement
**File:** `resources/js/Pages/Auth/Register.jsx`

#### New Features:
- Profile picture upload field added
- Reorganized "Additional Information" section with:
  - Profile Picture upload
  - Emirates ID Number
  - Emirates ID Copy upload
- All three fields are optional
- Uses FileUpload component for consistent UI

### 5. Profile Page Enhancement
**File:** `resources/js/Pages/Agent/Profile.jsx`

#### New Features:
- Profile picture upload field
- Display uploaded profile image in avatar section
- If no profile image, shows initials in colored circle (fallback)
- Option to replace existing profile picture
- Visual indicator when profile picture is already uploaded
- Renamed section to "Profile & Emirates ID Information"

### 6. Quote Request Form Cleanup
**File:** `resources/js/Pages/Agent/QuoteRequest.jsx`

#### Removed Fields:
**From Principal Applicant Details:**
- ❌ Profile Picture upload (now in profile)
- ❌ Emirates ID Copy upload (now in profile)

**From Dependents Section:**
- ❌ Profile Picture upload for each dependent

**Added Information Notice:**
- Blue info box informing users that their profile picture and Emirates ID will be used from their profile
- Link to profile settings for easy updates

#### Retained Fields:
- Emirates ID Copy for dependents (since dependents may not have user profiles)

### 7. UI Component Updates

#### DashboardHeader.jsx
- Updated to show profile image if uploaded
- Falls back to initials if no image
- Maintains circular avatar design with border

#### DashboardAside.jsx  
- Updated sidebar user info to show profile image
- Falls back to colored circle with initials if no image
- Consistent styling with gold accent border
